# Sebastian Knight – Portfolio (Static Site)

Pages:
- `index.html` – Home / About + featured project
- `projects.html` – Project cards with View Code / Live Demo
- `contact.html` – Contact and links
- `style.css` – Shared styles
- `assets/` – Images (replace placeholders)

## Usage
1) Replace `youruser` and `yourprofile` in links with real GitHub and LinkedIn.
2) Replace placeholder images in `assets/` with real screenshots.
3) (Optional) Include a PDF CV at the root and update the link in the Home CTA.
4) Push to a GitHub repo and enable **GitHub Pages** (branch: `main`, folder: `/root`).

## Notes
- Clean, responsive design with simple CSS only (no frameworks).
- All links open in a new tab where appropriate.
